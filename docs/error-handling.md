_Coming soon!_

<!--

- TODO: build error message with context while keeping the stack trace, eg:
    Unique email constraint failure\nCreating new user account
- The different error handling middlewares included in the service
- How req validation should be handled with JSON schemas and then logged for errors
- How uncaught exceptions are caught by error handling middleware and logged
- How errors are internally logged and then a sanitized res is sent
- How to create a custom error class definition and use for failing reqs, eg the auth errors
